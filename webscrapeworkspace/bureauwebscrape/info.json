Governments also employ forest and conservation workers on a contract basis.\n How to Become a Forest and Conservation Worker\nForest and conservation workers typically need a high school diploma before they begin working. Most workers receive training on the job.\n    Pay\nThe median annual wage for forest and conservation workers was $26,940 in May 2016.\n     Job Outlook \nEmployment of forest and conservation workers is projected to show little or no change from 2016 to 2026. Although heightened international demand for U.S. timber and wood pellets will continue to demand forest and conservation workers, improved technology will also lessen the need for workers to perform certain tasks.\n     State & Area Data \n    Explore resources for employment and wages by state and area for forest and conservation workers.\n     Similar Occupations\n    Compare the job duties, education, job growth, and pay of forest and conservation workers with similar occupations.\n    More Information, Including Links to O*NET\n    Learn more about forest and conservation workers by visiting additional resources, including O*NET, a source on key characteristics of workers and occupations.\n"

For example, workers help count how many trees will be affected by a fire. They also sometimes respond to forest emergencies."
